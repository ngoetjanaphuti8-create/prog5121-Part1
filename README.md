# PROG5121 - Part 1: Registration and Login

A console-only Java application implementing the registration and login
feature described in the PROG5121 Part 1 PoE brief (100 marks).

## What's included

- `src/main/java/chatapp/Login.java` — the core class with all required methods:
  `checkUserName()`, `checkPasswordComplexity()`, `checkCellPhoneNumber()`,
  `registerUser()`, `loginUser()`, `returnLoginStatus()`.
- `src/main/java/chatapp/Main.java` — console app that walks a user through
  registering and logging in.
- `src/test/java/chatapp/LoginTest.java` — JUnit 5 tests using the exact test
  data given in the brief (all 14 tests pass).
- `pom.xml` — Maven project file (JUnit 5 + Surefire so `mvn test` runs the tests).

## Design notes

- **First and last name are captured at registration**, alongside username,
  password and cell number. This is needed so that a successful login can
  return the personalized welcome message, `"Welcome <first name>, <last
  name> it is great to see you again."`
- **`registerUser()` validates fields in order** — username, then password,
  then cell number — returning the message for the first check that fails,
  or a combined success message once all three pass.

## How to run it yourself

You'll need a JDK (17+) and Maven installed, or just NetBeans/IntelliJ.

```bash
# Run the unit tests
mvn test

# Run the console app
mvn compile exec:java
```

If you're using NetBeans, just open this folder as an existing Maven
project — NetBeans will pick up the `pom.xml` automatically, and you can
right-click `LoginTest.java` → "Test File" to run the tests.

## Version control

This project is pushed to GitHub with a minimum of six commits, tracking the
project setup, the `Login` class, the console app, and the unit tests as
separate stages of the work.

## Video presentation

## Status\nAll 14 unit tests passing.

An unlisted video walkthrough accompanies this submission, showing the
application running and explaining the logic and flow behind it — including
the validation regex, the order in which `registerUser()` checks each field,
and how the JUnit tests map to the required test data.
